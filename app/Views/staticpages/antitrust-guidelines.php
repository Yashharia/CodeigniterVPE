                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE SHERMAN ACT prohibits any joint agreement or understanding affecting the price of a product, regardless of the pur­pose of the understanding. A price-fixing violation may be inferred from similar price behavior by competitors, even in the absence of an oral or written agreement. Mere attendance at meetings in which illegal price fixing is discussed may be suffi­cient to imply acquiescence to the plans discussed, and thereby make the individual liable to as great a penalty as those who were active participants.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMIS­SION ACT, unlike the Sherman Act, reaches anti-competitive acts committed by single persons or companies, whether or not there is any agreement or “combina­tion”; like the Sherman Act, it also covers joint actions.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States have statutes with provision for enforcement of their state law on antitrust and each Office of the Attorney General has an antitrust unit that is authorized to proceed under both federal and state antitrust laws.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPE, in its regular course of business, conducts meetings and other cooperative activities between companies that may be competitors. VPE emphasizes its commitment to comply strict­ly and in all respects with the antitrust laws of the United States and each of the states. As a practical matter, such com­pliance is almost always a safeguard against violation of state or federal antitrust statutes.</span></p>

                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To guard against unintentional conduct, all VPE meetings, including virtual meetings, conference calls, chats, shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures. Trade associations using VPE and its meeting platforms are urged to to adhere to the following:</span></p>
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A written agenda will be prepared for each meeting and will be reviewed in advance by legal counsel</span></li>

                                                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Association meetings will be properly scheduled;, no “rump” sessions will be permitted.</span></li>
                                                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any doubt concerning the propriety of any topic or discussion, consult VPE or association staff or legal counsel before raising the issue in open session.</span></li>

                                                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in doubt, ASK</span></li>

                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ANTITRUST GUIDELINES</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Antitrust Laws are a comprehen­sive charter of economic controls aimed at promoting free competition. These laws rest upon the premise that the preserva­tion of free competition will yield the best allocation of economic resources, the low­est prices, and the greatest material progress for the public welfare. Under the Antitrust Laws, competitors may not restrain competition via agreements or under­standings regarding the price, production or distribution of products and services.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors may not engage in any activity intended to restrict the competitive capability of their customers, suppliers, or other competitors.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Antitrust Laws are immensely com­plex and are often of unclear applicability. Unlawful agreements can be inferred from circumstantial evidence. A conviction for violating the Antitrust Laws may result in stiff fines, extended jail sentences for indi­viduals who participate in the violation, and forced disbanding of their trade asso­ciation. Even if an antitrust case is won or settled, the demands upon the time of those involved can be tremendous. Legal fees and costs can easily run into the six-figure range and more.</span></p>
                                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines that follow are designed to assist you in avoiding even the appearance of questionable activity.
