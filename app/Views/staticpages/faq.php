With over 125 supplier/exhibitor/speaker participants the feedback we are receiving from the industry has been overwhelmingly positive. ​Participation is free. Premium Service are available.</p>

The premise was always that a strong propane industry needed a strong group of suppliers to support the needs of a vibrant and growing propane marketer force.</p>
                                                            <p><strong>Shane Sweet</strong>, who has served as an Executive for a number of energy trade associations, including the Vermont Fuel Dealers Association, New England Fuel Institute and most recently the New York Propane Gas Association, and <strong>Mike Digiorgio</strong> (President of Propane University, Founder of Silverback consulting and President of the Propane Legal Defense Association) were instrumental in providing advice, counsel and early development of the platform, as well as promotion of the new site to the propane industry.</p>

We are glad that <strong>Stuart Flatow</strong> (former VP of PERC) agreed to serve in a consultative role with the greater goal to use this venue to serve the industry in a new way that would benefit suppliers, marketers, associations and propane users.</p>
